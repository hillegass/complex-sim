    "According to [Mother Earth News](https://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/rabbits-on-pasture-intensive-grazing-with-bunnies-zbcz1504), a rabbit eats six square feet of pasture per day. Let's assume that our rabbits live in a five acre clearing in a forest: 217,800 square feet/6 square feet = 36,300 rabbit-days worth of food. For simplicity, let's assume the grass grows back in two months. Thus, the carrying capacity of five acres is 36,300/60 = 605 rabbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Female rabbits reproduce about six to seven times per year. They have six to ten children in a litter.  According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit), a wild rabbit reaches sexual maturity when it is about six months old and typically lives one to two years. For simplicity, let's assume that in the presence of unlimited food, a rabbit lives forever, is immediately sexually mature, and has 1.5 children every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, then, let $x_t$ be the number of rabbits in our five acre clearing on month $t$.\n",

    "According to [Huntwise](https://www.besthuntingtimes.com/blog/2020/2/3/why-you-should-coyote-hunt-how-to-get-started), coyotes need to consume about 2-3 pounds of food per day. Their diet is 90 percent mammalian. The perfect adult cottontail rabbits weigh 2.6 pounds on average. Thus, we assume the coyote eats one rabbit per day. \n",

    "For coyotes, the breeding season is in February and March. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote#Social_and_reproductive_behaviors), females have a gestation period of 63 days, with an average litter size of 6, though the number fluctuates depending on coyote population density and the abundance of food. By fall, the pups are old enough to hunt for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of rabbits, the number of coyotes will drop, as their food supply is scarce.\n",

    "If a prey agent meets a predator agent, it dies with some probability because of predation. We will implement death as the removal of the prey from the preys agents list.\n",
    "If a predator agent can't find any prey agents nearby, it dies with some probability because of the lack of food. Otherwise, it will reproduce at a certain reproduction rate. \n",
    "According to [Purely Facts](http://purelyfacts.com/question/12/which-is-faster-a-coyote-or-a-rabbit?DDA=28&DDB=98),  the top speed is roughly 64 kph for coyote, and 4 kph for rabbit, so let's assume coyotes are 15 times faster than rabbit. Furthermore, to ensure our simulation model can naturally handle situations where the size of the agent population changes rapidly, and guarantees that each agent is updated once, on average, in each unit time length, we defined a update_one_unit_time() function to address the issue. We make the unit length of time passes by in each asynchronous updating proportional to the size of the agent populationat the time of updating. This way, the progress of time will be steady in the simulation, even if the number of agents changes over time."
