Let's assume that our rabbits live in a five acre clearing in a forest: 217,800 square feet/6 square feet = 36,300 rabbit-days worth of food.

In the code, we use r_init and c_init to represent the initial population of rabbits and coyotes.

Furthermore, to ensure our simulation model can naturally handle situations where the size of the agent population changes rapidly, and guarantees that each agent is updated once, on average, in each unit time length, we defined a update_one_unit_time() function to address the issue. We make the unit length of time passes by in each asynchronous updating proportional to the size of the agent populationat the time of updating. This way, the progress of time will be steady in the simulation, even if the number of agents changes over time."
