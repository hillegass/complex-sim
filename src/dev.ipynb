    "According to [Mother Earth News](https://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/rabbits-on-pasture-intensive-grazing-with-bunnies-zbcz1504), a rabbit eats six square feet of pasture per day. Let's assume that our rabbits live in a five acre clearing in a forest: 217,800 square feet/6 square feet = 36,300 rabbit-days worth of food. For simplicity, let's assume the grass grows back in two months. Thus, the carrying capacity of five acres is 36,300/60 = 605 rabbits.\n",

    "Female rabbits reproduce about six to seven times per year. They have six to ten children in a litter.  According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit), a wild rabbit reaches sexual maturity when it is about six months old and typically lives one to two years. For simplicity, let's assume that in the presence of unlimited food, a rabbit lives forever, is immediately sexually mature, and has 1.5 children every month.\n",
